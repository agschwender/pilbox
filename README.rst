Pilbox is an image processing application server built on Python's
`Tornado web framework <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_ using
the `Python Imaging Library
(Pillow) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/>`_. It is not
intended to be the primary source of images, but instead acts as a proxy
which requests images and resizes them as desired.

Setup
=====

Dependencies
------------

-  `Python >= 2.7 <http://www.python.org/download/>`_
-  `Pillow 2.9.0 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.9.0>`_
-  `Tornado 4.5.1 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tornado/4.5.1>`_
-  `OpenCV 2.x <http://opencv.org/>`_ (optional)
-  `PycURL 7.x <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_ (optional, but
   recommended; required for proxy requests and requests over TLS)
-  Image Libraries: libjpeg-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libwebp-dev,
   zlib1g-dev, liblcms2-dev

Pilbox highly recommends installing ``libcurl`` and ``pycurl`` in order
to get better HTTP request performance as well as additional features
such as proxy requests and requests over TLS. Installed versions of
``libcurl`` should be a minimum of ``7.21.1`` and ``pycurl`` should be a
minimum of ``7.18.2``. Furthermore, it is recommended that the
``libcurl`` installation be built with asynchronous DNS resolver
(threaded or c-ares), otherwise it may encounter various problems with
request timeouts (for more information, see `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUTMS>`_
and comments in `curl_httpclient.py <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/master/tornado/curl_httpclient.py>`_)

-  *expand*: Expand the size to include the full rotated image

Security-related Parameters
---------------------------

-  *client*: The client name
-  *sig*: The signature

The ``url`` parameter is always required as it dictates the image that
will be manipulated. ``op`` is optional and defaults to ``resize``. It
also supports a comma separated list of operations, where each operation
is applied in the order that it appears in the list. Depending on the
operation, additional parameters are required. All image manipulation
requests accept ``exif``, ``fmt``, ``opt``, ``prog`` and ``q``. ``exif``
is optional and default to ``0`` (not preserved). ``fmt`` is optional
and defaults to the source image format. ``opt`` is optional and
defaults to ``0`` (disabled). ``prog`` is optional and default to ``0``
(disabled). ``q`` is optional and defaults to ``90``. To ensure
security, all requests also support, ``client`` and ``sig``. ``client``
is required only if the ``client_name`` is defined within the
configuration file. Likewise, ``sig`` is required only if the
``client_key`` is defined within the configuration file. See the
`Signing`_ section for details on how to generate the signature.

For resizing, either the ``w`` or ``h`` parameter is required. If only
one dimension is specified, the application will determine the other
dimension using the aspect ratio. ``mode`` is optional and defaults to
``crop``. ``filter`` is optional and defaults to ``antialias``. ``bg``
is optional and defaults to ``0fff``. ``pos`` is optional and defaults
to ``center``. ``retain`` is optional and defaults to ``75``.

For region sub-selection, ``rect`` is required. For rotating, ``deg`` is
required. ``expand`` is optional and defaults to ``0`` (disabled). It is
recommended that this feature not be used as it typically does not
produce high quality images.

Note, all built-in defaults can be overridden by setting them in the
configuration file. See the `Configuration`_ section
for more details.

Examples
========

The following images show the various resizing modes in action for an
original image size of ``640x428`` that is being resized to ``500x400``.

Adapt
-----

The adaptive resize mode combines both `crop`_ and `fill`_ resize modes
to ensure that the image always matches the requested size and a minimum
percentage of the image is always visible. Adaptive resizing will first
calculate how much of the image will be retained if crop is used. Then,
if that percentage is equal to or above the requested minimum retained
percentage, crop mode will be used. If it is not, fill will be used. The
first figure uses a ``retain`` value of ``80`` to illustrate the
adaptive crop behavior.

     :align: center
     :alt: Adaptive cropped image

Whereas the second figure requires a minimum of ``99`` to illustrate the
adaptive fill behavior

     :align: center
     :alt: Adaptive filled image

Clip
----

The image is resized to fit within a ``500x400`` box, maintaining aspect
ratio and producing an image that is ``500x334``. Clipping is useful
when no portion of the image can be lost and it is acceptable that the
image not be exactly the supplied dimensions, but merely fit within the
dimensions.

     :align: center
     :alt: Clipped image

Crop
----

The image is resized so that one dimension fits within the ``500x400``
box. It is then centered and the excess is cut from the image. Cropping
is useful when the position of the subject is known and the image must
be exactly the supplied size.

     :align: center
     :alt: Cropped image


Fill
----

Similar to clip, fill resizes the image to fit within a ``500x400`` box.
Once clipped, the image is centered within the box and all left over
space is filled with the supplied background color. Filling is useful
when no portion of the image can be lost and it must be exactly the
supplied size.

.. figure:: https://github.com/agschwender/pilbox/raw/master/pilbox/test/data/expected/example-500x400-mode=fill-background=ccc.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: Filled image


Scale
-----

The image is clipped to fit within the ``500x400`` box and then
stretched to fill the excess space. Scaling is often not useful in
production environments as it generally produces poor quality images.
This mode is largely included for completeness.

    :align: center
    :alt: Scale image

Signing
=======

In order to secure requests so that unknown third parties cannot easily
use the resize service, the application can require that requests
provide a signature. To enable this feature, set the ``client_key``
option. The signature is a hexadecimal digest generated from the client
key and the query string using the HMAC-SHA1 message authentication code
(MAC) algorithm. The below python code provides an example
implementation.

::

    import hashlib
    import hmac

    def derive_signature(key, qs):
        m = hmac.new(key, None, hashlib.sha1)
        m.update(qs)
        return m.hexdigest()

The signature is passed to the application by appending the ``sig``
parameter to the query string; e.g.
``x=1&y=2&z=3&sig=c9516346abf62876b6345817dba2f9a0c797ef26``. Note, the
application does not include the leading question mark when verifying
the supplied signature. To verify your signature implementation, see the
``pilbox.signature`` command described in the `Tools`_ section.

Configuration
=============

All options that can be supplied to the application via the command
line, can also be specified in the configuration file. Configuration
files are simply python files that define the options as variables. The
below is an example configuration.

::

    # General settings
    port = 8888

    # Set client name and key if the application requires signed requests. The
    # client must sign the request using the client_key, see README for
    # instructions.
    client_name = "sample"
    client_key = "3NdajqH8mBLokepU4I2Bh6KK84GUf1lzjnuTdskY"

    # Set the allowed hosts as an alternative to signed requests. Only those
    # images which are served from the following hosts will be requested.
    allowed_hosts = ["localhost"]

    # Request-related settings
    max_requests = 50
    timeout = 7.5

    # Set default resizing options
    background = "ccc"
    filter = "bilinear"
    mode = "crop"
    position = "top"

    # Set default rotating options
    expand = False

    # Set default saving options
    format = None
    optimize = 1
    quality = "90"

Tools
=====

To verify that your client application is generating correct signatures,
use the signature command.

::

    $ python -m pilbox.signature --key=abcdef "x=1&y=2&z=3"
    Query String: x=1&y=2&z=3
    Signature: c9516346abf62876b6345817dba2f9a0c797ef26
    Signed Query String: x=1&y=2&z=3&sig=c9516346abf62876b6345817dba2f9a0c797ef26

The application allows the use of the resize functionality via the
command line.

::

    $ python -m pilbox.image --width=300 --height=300 http://i.imgur.com/zZ8XmBA.jpg > /tmp/foo.jpg

If a new mode is added or a modification was made to the libraries that
would change the current expected output for tests, run the generate
test command to regenerate the expected output for the test cases.

::

    $ python -m pilbox.test.genexpected

Deploying
=========

It is strongly encouraged that pilbox not be directly accessible to
the internet. Instead, it should only be accessible via a web server,
e.g. NGINX or Apache, or some other application that is designed to
handle direct traffic from the internet.

The application itself does not include any caching. It is recommended
that the application run behind a CDN for larger applications or behind
varnish for smaller ones.

Defaults for the application have been optimized for quality rather than
performance. If you wish to get higher performance out of the
application, it is recommended you use a less computationally expensive
filtering algorithm and a lower JPEG quality. For example, add the
following to the configuration.

::

    # Set default resizing options
    filter = "bicubic"
    quality = 75

If you wish to improve performance further and are using an x86 platform, you may want to consider using `Pillow-SIMD <https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd/>`_. Follow the steps in `Installation <https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd#installation>`_ and it should function as a drop-in replacement for ``Pillow``. To avoid any incompatibility issues, use the same version of ``Pillow-SIMD`` as is being used for ``Pillow``.

Extension
=========

While it is generally recommended to use Pilbox as a standalone server, it can also be used as a library. To extend from it and build a custom image processing server, use the following example.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import tornado.gen

    from pilbox.app import PilboxApplication, ImageHandler, \
        start_server, parse_command_line


    class CustomApplication(PilboxApplication):
        def get_handlers(self):
            return [(r"/(\d+)x(\d+)/(.+)", CustomImageHandler)]


    class CustomImageHandler(ImageHandler):
        def prepare(self):
            self.args = self.request.arguments.copy()

        @tornado.gen.coroutine
        def get(self, w, h, url):
            self.args.update(dict(w=w, h=h, url=url))

            self.validate_request()
            resp = yield self.fetch_image()
            self.render_image(resp)

        def get_argument(self, name, default=None):
            return self.args.get(name, default)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        parse_command_line()
        start_server(CustomApplication())
